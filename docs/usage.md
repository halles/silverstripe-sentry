# Usage

Once setup, everytime an `Exception` is thrown or PHP itself shuts down via `trigger_error()` etc or you "manually" trigger a log message to be sent to Sentry, all
available data is automatically sent.

In addition to the module simply reporting all thrown `Exception`s, resulting in a stacktrace in Sentry itself, you can use Sentry as a simple logger
with all the benefits of Sentry's tags and grouping. See the examples below.

## Manual Logging

### SilverStripe 3

Set the following in your project's `_config.php`, to stipulate what the error-reporting threshold is.

    SS_Log::add_writer(\phptek\Sentry\SentryLogWriter::factory(), SS_Log::ERR, '<=');

### SilverStripe 4

Nothing to do, the logger is registered via YML config as a Monolog Handler within the module itself.

## Set an environment

For "manual" error-reporting, you can augment your message with some context. If an environment is not specified,
the default is to use the return value of `Director::get_environment_type()`.

### SilverStripe 3

    $config = ['env' => 'live'];
    SS_Log::add_writer(\phptek\Sentry\SentryLogWriter::factory($config), SS_Log::ERR, '<=');

### SilverStripe 4

SilverStripe 4 uses `Monolog` and individual handlers for logging. Once you instantiate a `Logger` object, you have access to `Monolog`'s public API.
    
    $config = ['env' => 'live'];
    $logger = Injector::inst()->createWithArgs(Logger::class, ['error-log'])
        ->pushHandler(SentryHandler::create());

    // Send an `ERROR` level message
    $logger->error($message, $config);

    // Send a `WARN` level message
    $logger->warning($message, $config);

    // Send an `INFO` level message
    $logger->info($message, $config);

## Set tags

Sentry allows for custom key-value pairs to be recorded against each message that it is sent.
These are known as "tags", and they allow for fine-grained grouping and filtering of messages via the Sentry UI.

Note: It makes no sense to send hugely varying data in a tag. If it's unlikely that a tag you
wish to send, is ever going to be repeated, don't send it as a tag. Look at using the "Extras" feature (described below)
instead.

### SilverStripe 3

    $config = [
        'env' => 'live',
        'tags' = [
            'Unique-ID' => 44
        ]
    ];
    SS_Log::add_writer(\phptek\Sentry\SentryLogWriter::factory($config), SS_Log::ERR, '<=');

### SilverStripe 4

    $config = [
        'env' => 'live',
        'tags' = [
            'Unique-ID' => 44,
            'Foo' => 'Bar',
        ]
    ];
    $logger = Injector::inst()->createWithArgs(Logger::class, ['error-log'])
        ->pushHandler(SentryHandler::create());

    // Send an `ERROR` level message
    $logger->error($message, $config);

    // Send a `WARN` level message
    $logger->warning($message, $config);

    // Send an `INFO` level message
    $logger->info($message, $config);

## Set extras

Once a message is selected within the Sentry UI, additional, arbitrary data can be displayed 
to further help with debugging. You can opt to send this as a consistent "baked-in" set of values
from within `_config.php` or at runtime, via passing the optional 3rd parameter to `SS_Log::log()`.

### SilverStripe 3

### Via _config.php

    $config = [
        'env' => 'live',
        'tags' => [
            'Unique-ID' => 44
        ],
        extra => [
            'Moon-Phase' => 'Full',
            'Tummy-Status' => 'Empty',
            'Cats' => 'Are furry'
        ]
    ];
    SS_Log::add_writer(\phptek\Sentry\SentryLogWriter::factory($config), SS_Log::ERR, '<=');

### Via SS_Log::log()

Setting-up everything you think you want to send, all from one spot in `_config.php` is somewhat inflexible. Using the following however,
we can set additional, arbitrary and context-specific data to be sent to Sentry via calls to `SS_Log::log()` and its optional
3rd parameter. You can then call `SS_Log::log()` in your project's customised Exception classes.

In order to inject additional data into a message at runtime, simply pass a 2-dimensional array
to the 3rd parameter of `SS_Log::log()` who's first key is "extra" and who's value is an array of values
comprising the data you wish to send:

    SS_Log::log('Help, my curry is too hot. I only asked for mild.', SS_Log::ERR, ['extra' => ['toilet' => 'now']]);

### SilverStripe 4

    $logger = Injector::inst()->createWithArgs(Logger::class, ['error-log'])
        ->pushHandler(SentryHandler::create());

    // Send an `ERROR` level message
    $logger->log('ERROR', 'Help, my curry is too hot. I only asked for mild.', ['extra' => ['toilet' => 'now']]);
